# Custom JupyterHub Templates for Pangeo

This repo contains html jinja2 templates for customising the appearance of JupyterHub. Each HTML file here will override the files in `https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/tree/master/share/jupyter/hub/templates`.

This is used in conjunction with https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-cloud-federation/tree/staging/deployments/icesat2
